/*
    For running fpga simulation with caravel, we have to simulate with the fpga gate-level netlists.
    This is because the fpga rtl has hand-instantiated cells from the pdk, these cells aren't connected to power pins 
    which fails the simulation with caravel due to the use of "USE_POWER_PINS".
